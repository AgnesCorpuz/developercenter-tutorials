    The main objective of this tutorial is to showcase how to create an interaction, and send SMS using Platform API. The given sample code will send a message after an agent drops off a call made through a queue. This tutorial will also cover how to listen to a topic from a pre-created channel.

    First, authenticate the application with pureCloud.

    Create an instance of the websocket object that will listen to the topic {"id": "v2.routing.queues.{queueID}.conversations.calls"}. For convenience, a notification channel subscribed to a queues call flow, is already created. For more information about Notification API refer the following resources below:

    To identify if the caller is using a mobile number, an IVR is created to prommpt the user with a question if he is using a mobile number. The customers input will be in the message that the websocket will recieve as participant attribute. This is one of many ways to check if a caller is using a mobile number.  
    Every message from the webSocket, identify the state of the call, the customer address i.e., conatact number, and lastly the customer attribute.
