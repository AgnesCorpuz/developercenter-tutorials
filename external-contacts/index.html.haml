            External Contacts is a comprehensive repository of data about your external organizations and contacts. You can see a streamlined view of all contact and organization data and start a call, send an email, or visit a contact’s website directly from a contact’s record.

            Loading external contacts doesn't have to be a manual process and this tutorial will walk through the steps of creating external contacts sourced by a csv file.

            For mor information on external contacts see the [Resource Center](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/about-external-contacts/)
    .step{:data=>{:title=>'Create an Organization'}}
        :markdown
            Assuming we already have an established authenticated session to PureCloud, the first thing we are going to do is create a new organization which all of our contacts will be a part of.

            We can create the ExternalOrganization entity, specifiying the fields that are relevant to our use case, and then call postOrganizations to create the organization.

            The response from this post will contain an id property which we will use to associate our contacts to this organization.

    .step{:data=>{:title=>'Create Users'}}
        :markdown
            After we read our csv file we can iterate over each user. In our csv file the first row is the colum names so we will start at index = 1.

             In order to tie the new user to the organization we just created, we need to set the organization id to the externalOrganization.id property of the new user.

             Once we have the new user created, we can call postContacts and create the user.
